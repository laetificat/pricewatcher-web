# Pricewatcher web
This project is a frontend for the [Pricewatcher API](https://github.com/laetificat/pricewatcher-api), it fetches all the 
prices from all the watchers and creates a graph for each watcher.

## Configuring
Edit the `app.js` and change the url in the `$.get()` to your pricewatcher `/watchers` endpoint.
